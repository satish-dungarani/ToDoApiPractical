# Solution Structure

This document provides an overview of the solution's structure, key coding decisions, and practices that ensure the application is reliable, maintainable, and scalable.

## Project Structure

### 1. Controllers
**Purpose**: Define the app's endpoints, handle HTTP requests, and send responses.

**Examples**:
- **CategoryController.cs**: Manages categories (e.g., creating, reading, updating, and deleting).
- **TodoController.cs**: Focuses on operations for "ToDo" items.
- **WeatherToDoCombinedController.cs**: Combines weather information with "ToDo" tasks based on client needs.

### 2. DataContext
**Purpose**: Manage database interactions using Entity Framework.

**Examples**:
- **AppDbContext.cs**: Maps database tables to C# classes (e.g., `TodoItem`).
- **AppDbContextFetch.cs**: Fetches data from external sources such as [dummyjson.com](https://dummyjson.com/todos).

### 3. Domains
**Purpose**: Define core data models that represent your database tables.

**Examples**:
- **Category.cs**: Represents a category record in the database.
- **TodoItem.cs**: Represents a "ToDo" task.

### 4. ErrorLogs
**Purpose**: Write logs using the log4net library at all levels.

### 5. Helpers
**Purpose**: Provide reusable utility functions to simplify coding tasks.

**Examples**:
- **Helpers.cs**: Contains general-purpose helper functions.
- **LogHelper.cs**: A static logger instance for logging activities using log4net.

### 6. Migrations
**Purpose**: Track database schema changes over time, ensuring updates without data loss.

### 7. Models
**Purpose**: Define data models for sending and receiving data through the API while keeping internal data structures secure.

### 8. Services
**Purpose**: Implement the app's core functionality in the business logic layer.

**Examples**:
- **CategoryService.cs**: Handles logic for categories.
- **TodoItemService.cs**: Manages "ToDo" tasks.
- **Interfaces**: Define the capabilities of services, ensuring easy testing and expansion.

### 9. Configuration Files
- **appsettings.json**: Stores app settings such as database connection info.
- **log4net.config**: Configures logging activities.

### 10. Program.cs
**Purpose**: Acts as the entry point of the application, setting up services and middleware (e.g., dependency injection and routing).

### 11. ToDoApiPractical.Tests
**Purpose**: Include unit and integration tests to ensure the application works as expected.

## Key Coding Decisions

### 1. Organized Structure
The project separates responsibilities into distinct layers (e.g., controllers, services, and database layers). This improves readability, maintainability, and scalability.

### 2. Dependency Injection
The application uses dependency injection to manage interactions between components, making the app more modular and testable.

### 3. Async for Better Performance
Asynchronous methods (async/await) enable non-blocking operations for tasks like database queries, improving performance under heavy load.

### 4. Clear Data Mapping
Internal models are separated from the data sent to users, ensuring security and controlled information sharing.

### 5. Error Handling
Thoughtful error handling provides helpful error messages instead of crashes or ambiguous responses. For example, non-existent items return clear "not found" messages. Internally, the log4net library captures logs in a text file for debugging and analysis.

### 6. Efficient Queries
Optimized LINQ queries fetch only the necessary data, reducing database load and improving speed.

This structure and these practices ensure that the application is robust, user-friendly, and ready to accommodate future growth.
